EGG SORTER SYSTEM
The conveyer carry eggs.
The 1th PresenceSensor detects one egg.
The 1th PresenceSensor calls SmartVision.
SmartVision checks if egg is 0 (good) or 1 (odd).
SmartVision sends the result to AMQ.
The 2nd PresenceSensor detects one egg.
The 2nd PresenceSensor calls a balance.
Balance checks if egg is 0 (a, Premium) or 1 (b, Common).
Balance sends the result to AMQ.
The 3nd PresenceSensor detecs one egg.
The 3nd PresenceSensor calls Sorter
Sorter gets the result from SmartVision and Balance.
Sorter open transfer 1 for 00, transfer 2 for 01, 10, and 11

An asp shows how many eggs type A and B per shift. Another screen allow to reset SmartV and Balance and send the current 2 results to /dev/null (in case an egg brake and the transfer be not necessary).

This system requires the Podman container running AMQ (see the Podman branch, activity 3, in my github).
